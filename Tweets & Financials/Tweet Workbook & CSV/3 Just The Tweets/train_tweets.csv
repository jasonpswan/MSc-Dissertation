2020-01-10,Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank ‚Äî it‚Äôs just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don‚Äôt collapse when depressurized on the ground.
2020-01-10,"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
2020-01-10,A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
2020-01-10,"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts & better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

2019-12-30,We‚Äôre focusing on Boca right now for Starship & Cape is focused on Falcon/Dragon
2019-12-30,Spin start from COPVs so the ox & fuel turbines spool up super fast in unison. A precise start with full flow staged combustion is very important.
2019-12-30,"Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool."

2019-09-14,"Exactly! We‚Äôve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
2019-09-14,"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don‚Äôt raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
2019-09-14,"That‚Äôs not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I‚Äôm looking into it"
2019-09-14,"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
2019-09-14,"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
2019-09-14,Agreed
2019-09-14,"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
2019-09-14,"There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
2019-09-14,"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."

2019-07-16,"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can‚Äôt make enough of them & we won‚Äôt be able to."

2019-06-27,That‚Äôs actually kinda true
2019-06-26,Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn‚Äôt have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
2019-06-26,You‚Äôre touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We‚Äôre fixing that with Starship.
2019-06-26,"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney‚Äôs Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you‚Äôd exit on another continent."
2019-06-26,"~1000, as all seats would be ‚Äúcoach‚Äù & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It‚Äôs basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
2019-06-26,"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
2019-06-26,"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low"
2019-06-26,There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
2019-06-26,"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
2019-06-26,"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work."
2019-06-26,Probably sooner

2019-06-24,"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness & needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms ü§ó"
2019-06-24,It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
2019-06-24,"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
2019-06-24,"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
2019-06-24,Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

2019-06-24,"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design & replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

2019-05-26,Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy & internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.

2019-02-21,"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done."
2019-02-21,"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
2019-02-21,"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
2019-02-21,You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
2019-02-21,Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
2019-02-21,"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
2019-02-21,"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
2019-02-21,"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ‚ò∫Ô∏èHigh engine chamber pressure and ablative don‚Äôt get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
2019-02-21,"That‚Äôs true üòÄ Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
2019-02-21,"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for ‚Äúlaunch capability‚Äù. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."

2019-02-21,"Exactly. That‚Äôs the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
2019-02-21,"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I‚Äôm worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."

2019-02-11,"This will sound implausible, but I think there‚Äôs a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
2019-02-11,Close
2019-02-11,"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
2019-02-11,Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
2019-02-11,"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
2019-02-11,"Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
2019-02-11,I think 6 where we lit main chamber & several with only preburners

2018-12-19,"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."

2018-10-27,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."

2018-10-16,Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
2018-10-16,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."

2018-07-07,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.
2018-07-07,Yes
2018-07-07,"4 handles/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
2018-07-07,I‚Äôm in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
2018-07-07,"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
2018-07-07,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
2018-07-07,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
2018-07-07,Ground winds would
2018-07-07,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It‚Äôs a beast.
2018-07-07,Can‚Äôt be too buoyant
2018-07-07,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
2018-07-06,Good idea
2018-07-06,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."
2018-07-06,You‚Äôre welcome. Happy birthday! üéÅüéâüéÇ
2018-07-06,"Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
2018-07-06,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
2018-07-06,It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
2018-07-06,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
2018-07-06,I would def recommend this
2018-07-06,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
2018-07-06,Interesting
2018-07-06,"Great, thanks"
2018-07-06,Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
2018-07-06,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won‚Äôt come in"
2018-07-06,"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
2018-07-06,SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
2018-07-06,"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
2018-07-06,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
2018-07-06,Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
2018-07-06,"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
2018-07-06,Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

2018-07-05,TRUE

2018-07-05,"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
2018-07-05,"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings & extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst‚Äôs track record before hearing their opinion."

2018-07-05,".@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
2018-07-05,".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."

2018-06-20,@Money23Green Thanks for coming by our car factory with @westcoastbill. Tesla team was super fired up to see you! Congrats on your victory!!
2018-06-20,"Crazy, that was over 22 years ago. Thanks for believing in us!"
2018-06-20,"There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That‚Äôs still ~40 people."
2018-06-20,Today. It‚Äôs kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
2018-06-20,Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn‚Äôt change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.

2018-06-20,Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
2018-06-20,"Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high."
2018-06-20,Exactly
2018-06-20,"He‚Äôs obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak & a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
2018-06-20,Great name. A little on the nose.
2018-06-20,"That‚Äôs really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is."
2018-06-20,"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced & above 50% too negatively affects economic output."

2018-06-17,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
2018-06-17,"...which clearly doesn‚Äôt work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what‚Äôs happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they‚Äôre getting desperate."
2018-06-17,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
2018-06-17,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
2018-06-17,How big is your short position? Just curious.
2018-06-17,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy‚Äôs claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
2018-06-17,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
2018-06-17,"UAW doesn‚Äôt have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can‚Äôt even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they‚Äôre getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps."
2018-06-17,"I‚Äôm not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can‚Äôt compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don‚Äôt want Tesla to die too."

2018-05-24,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
2018-05-24,Gasoline or diesel?
2018-05-24,What car do you drive?
2018-05-24,March 15
2018-05-24,The media
2018-05-24,"Hi Kara! I‚Äôm open to it. Right now, I‚Äôm cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
2018-05-24,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Right!‚Äù  I do actually own  http://youreright.com¬†, but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
2018-05-24,Definitely
2018-05-24,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these üöó üöô and this is the best one üöò"
2018-05-24,Yo
2018-05-24,That‚Äôs the basic idea
2018-05-24,"For some reason, this is the best I‚Äôve felt in a while. Hope you‚Äôre feeling good too üöÄ‚ô•Ô∏èüåè"
2018-05-24,"I just tried to donate, but you don‚Äôt accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
2018-05-23,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
2018-05-23,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious ‚Ä¶
2018-05-23,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
2018-05-23,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
2018-05-23,"If you‚Äôre in media & don‚Äôt want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it ‚Ä¶"
2018-05-23,ü§ó
2018-05-23,"I‚Äôve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven‚Äôt forgotten UAW betrayed them. That‚Äôs why UAW can‚Äôt even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
2018-05-23,Of course
2018-05-23,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we‚Äôre doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."
2018-05-23,"No, they‚Äôre just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
2018-05-23,Will do
2018-05-23,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
2018-05-23,That‚Äôs why editors are included too
2018-05-23,We don‚Äôt. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
2018-05-23,"Even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
2018-05-23,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
2018-05-23,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
2018-05-23,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
2018-05-23,Exactly
2018-05-23,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda ‚Ä¶"
2018-05-23,An exception that proves the rule
2018-05-23,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
2018-05-23,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest advertisers."
2018-05-23,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
2018-05-23,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
2018-05-23,"Thought you‚Äôd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like Trump!‚Äù Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
2018-05-23,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://twitter.com/electrekco/status/999318852365303808¬†‚Ä¶"

2018-05-23,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
2018-05-23,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
2018-05-23,Great idea!
2018-05-22,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
2018-05-22,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
2018-05-22,Interesting he stops at ‚Äò09. That‚Äôs when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
2018-05-22,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It‚Äôs an off-menu item for those in the know üòâ
2018-05-22,"But ya know what, let‚Äôs test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let‚Äôs hold a vote & find out."
2018-05-22,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
2018-05-22,"We‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
2018-05-22,Good point
2018-05-22,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class ‚Äúlords & commoners‚Äù system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
2018-05-22,"More ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they‚Äôve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article ‚Ä¶"
2018-05-22,No problem
2018-05-22,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
2018-05-22,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
2018-05-22,I didn‚Äôt meet with him
2018-05-22,I definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can‚Äôt be creative otherwise.
2018-05-22,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
2018-05-22,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
2018-05-22,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
2018-05-22,"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production."
2018-05-22,ABS calibration algorithm
2018-05-22,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
2018-05-22,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
2018-05-22,"Stop, you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
2018-05-22,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
2018-05-22,Complexity is the devil. Words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we‚Äôll try.
2018-05-22,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
2018-05-22,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3‚Äôs have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we‚Äôve seen anything like this."
2018-05-22,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3‚Äôs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
2018-05-22,"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
2018-05-21,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
2018-05-21,Gwynne‚Äôs awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
2018-05-21,‚ô•Ô∏èü¶Ñ
2018-05-21,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
2018-05-21,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
2018-05-21,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal."

2018-05-21,For sure before snowfall this year
2018-05-21,It can tow far more than rated capacity
2018-05-21,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
2018-05-21,"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
2018-05-21,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
2018-05-21,Exactly üöÄüí´üéâ! That will be really fun & shed light on what‚Äôs happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
2018-05-21,"Yeah, ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today‚Äôs non-union."
2018-05-21,"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
2018-05-20,Yes
2018-05-20,Exactly
2018-05-20,They can form a union whenever they want & there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don‚Äôt want to.
2018-05-20,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It‚Äôs like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
2018-05-20,"They are correct. It‚Äôs awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
2018-05-20,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell"
2018-05-20,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
2018-05-20,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
2018-05-20,Good idea ...
2018-05-20,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
2018-05-20,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
2018-05-20,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
2018-05-20,Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
2018-05-20,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
2018-05-20,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
2018-05-20,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
2018-05-20,"It‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
2018-05-20,Exactly
2018-05-20,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
2018-05-20,I‚Äôm about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
2018-05-20,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
2018-05-20,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
2018-05-20,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20‚Äù Performance wheels, black & white interior."

2018-05-14,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
2018-05-14,"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
2018-05-14,What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
2018-05-14,"It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light/2018/05/12/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7466cb626644¬†‚Ä¶"
2018-05-14,Yes
2018-05-14,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
2018-05-14,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
2018-05-14,Happy Mother‚Äôs Day Mom! Love you so much.
2018-05-14,"Fair criticism, but we‚Äôre fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."

2018-05-13,Good piece by Ars https://twitter.com/arstechnica/status/995457711398678529¬†‚Ä¶
2018-05-13,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
2018-05-13,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî quaint, but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines & trains in general."
2018-05-13,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
2018-05-12,Yo
2018-05-11,Will make that a setting

2018-05-11,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ‚Ä¶"
2018-05-11,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
2018-05-11,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
2018-05-11,A cool thing about the design is that‚Äôs easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all

2017-05-23,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
2017-05-23,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
2017-05-23,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
2017-05-23,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
2017-05-23,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
2017-05-23,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian & cyclist safety"
2017-05-22,Exactly
2017-05-22,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
2017-05-22,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
2017-05-22,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.

2017-02-25,Roller coasters are awesome
2017-02-24,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
2017-02-24,Good chance it will
2017-02-24,Exactly :)
2017-02-24,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better

2017-02-18,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
2017-02-18,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
2017-02-18,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
2017-02-18,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
2017-02-18,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."

2017-02-05,No rare earth metals in battery
2017-02-05,Almost ready
2017-02-05,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
2017-02-05,"Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority"
2017-02-05,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
2017-02-05,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
2017-02-05,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
2017-02-05,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
2017-02-05,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
2017-02-05,Rolling out a new update today.
2017-02-05,We should try our best
2017-02-05,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."

2017-02-05,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
2017-02-05,True. Me being one of them :)
2017-02-05,"Not perfect & cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
2017-02-05,"Fair point, sorry"
2017-02-05,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"

2017-02-05,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
2017-02-05,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
2017-02-05,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
2017-02-05,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
2017-02-05,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
2017-02-05,Mostly anti-drug laws
2017-02-05,Exactly
2017-02-05,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
2017-02-05,The remedy for that is changing the law
2017-02-05,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
2017-02-05,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
2017-02-05,True!
2017-02-05,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."

2017-02-04,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
2017-02-04,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
2017-02-04,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
2017-02-04,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"

2016-05-27,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).

2016-05-01,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
2016-05-01,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
2016-05-01,"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
2016-05-01,"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
2016-05-01,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
2016-05-01,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
2016-05-01,"@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."
