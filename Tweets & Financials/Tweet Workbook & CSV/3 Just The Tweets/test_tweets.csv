2020-06-15,"Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners. The lower limit of thrust is ox & fuel turbopump injector preburner “stiffness”, essentially when do the preburner elements start flaming out."
2020-06-15,"Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
2020-06-15,"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed."
2020-06-15,Yes
2020-06-15,"That’s the goal. There a few known weak points on this test tank, probably capable of more pressure. The second test tank to follow shortly has addressed the weak points."

2020-06-10,"Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2."
2020-06-10,"We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights."

2020-05-09,Yes
2020-05-09,Tesla is the biggest manufacturer in California & second biggest exporter
2020-05-09,Exactly! Tesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County.
2020-05-09,"Absolutely, please do! You should be allowed to recoup damages from the county."
2020-05-09,"San Joaquin County, right next door to Alameda, has been sensible & reasonable, whereas Alameda has been irrational & detached from reality. Our castings foundry and other faculties in San Joaquin have been working 24/7 this entire time with no ill effects. Same with Giga Nevada."
2020-05-09,"Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA."
2020-05-09,"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected & ignorant “Interim Health Officer” of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!"

2020-05-08,That’s harder than it sounds. Will check with team.
2020-05-08,Ok
2020-05-08,!
2020-05-08,"No, but it’s mostly the same as the ship, except for the thrust bulkhead (31 engines vs 6)"
2020-05-08,"It’s not all about engineering, although that is my personal favorite. Striving to make products or provide services in excess of what you consume is the noble goal."
2020-05-08,"To be clear, I do think finance & law are important, but too many smart people in the US go into those fields. Also, too many MBAs."
2020-05-08,"Yes, mostly because you can use the ship every week going to the moon instead of every two years for Mars (best case)"
2020-05-08,Would be about 10 times that cost for payload to surface of Mars
2020-05-08,"Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg."

2020-05-07,Yeah!!
2020-05-07,"A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."

2020-05-07,"No, they will be smashed beyond repair & corroded"

2020-05-07,"Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!"
